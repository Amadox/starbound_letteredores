# LetteredOres

I found it difficult to recognize the differences between various ores. Worst offenders were Platinum vs Silver vs Titanium, and Gold vs Solarium. Although I'm not colorblind, I guess players who are will have an even harder time to distinguish various ores.

So I added a small letter colored like the ore itself above each ore type, to make them better recognizable.

The Mod is intended for Beta v. Upbeat Giraffe.

Works well in Combination with Illuminated Ores:
